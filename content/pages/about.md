### On email communication and love

We are about to tell you what our email address is. 

But before you sit down and doctor an email, let us be frank:  You are a good person, you deserve love and attention. That said, we are quite probably going to ignore whatever you send us. Not out of malice, nor spite, nor laziness. Not because you're not cool enough, beautiful enough or generally worthy of attention. No, rather, we are going to ignore your email because emails as well as most forms of digital communication are time and attention consuming, and the time we spend reading emails and composing polite responses is time we could have spent staring into the deep abyss of the iris of a loved one. And that is simply it: 9 times out of 10, the iris wins. It's the choice of champions. We stare at it, enjoy it, get enveloped by it, and the soul that seems to peek out at us from its depths, we greet it with a warm smile and murmur to ourselves "fuck an email, this is it, this is what life is all about. Just this"... _Wouldn't you like to do the same?_

If not, here is our email address: exformalrecords@gmail.com
