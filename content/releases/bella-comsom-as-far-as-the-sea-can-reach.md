# Between Two Seas

At the shoreline: I was searching for the point where the two sides of the sea met. There was a thin strip of land dividing the sea in two. In the recording, I am positioned on this line, listening between the two seas. Two seas, because the land divided them, according to the moon, the season, and the time of day. It was 11:16 in the morning on the island, during a waning moon. If the horizon line defines the end of what is seen from the sea, what would define the end from the land? And what would it be like to listen to this boundary?
