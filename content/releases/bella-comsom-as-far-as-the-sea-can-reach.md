# Between Two Seas

When there’s no more land ~ when water overtakes both sides ~ when an island reaches its end ~ yet there’s still a thin strip of earth that divides the sea in two - 
I was there, on that last boundary, that delicate thread that holds everything together.

It’s like the spine of the body, the column that keeps you upright while everything else falls away, the narrow path that stands between two worlds.

— Bella Comsom, 2025
