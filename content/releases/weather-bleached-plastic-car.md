I fall asleep at night as if unplugged. The thing is: I've run out of dreams. I fall asleep and it's all a vacuum. I ask anyone who will listen: What are your dreams? They misunderstand, they start talking about becoming a pop star, being right here right now, buying a house, etc. I should have asked: Can I have some dreams, please? I realise, this dream draught of mine is a symptom of a bigger, even scarier problem, according to my self diagnosis: An acute lack of subconsciousness. I feed my Id with horrific sci-fi literature about creatures tearing through space and time; every night on my pillow, hoping: come on Id, do your thing. Waking next morning with great expectations, only to be met with great disappointments. I keep an audio recorder by my bed and as soon as I wake, I start recording whatever I have been dealt through the night. Which is, to be frank, _nothing_.

After my morning routines, I seat myself by the piano, pressing one key at a time with ages of time in between, soaking up the vibrations of the metal seeping through the instrument's wooden enclosure, then turning my attention to the sounds from my open window, leaking in between the notes â€“ the banality of city sounds: Kids playing, a moped passing, bird feet rustling in the rain gutter above the window, it's the neighbourhood's magpies scheming again.

Days pass like this, one after the other. But then slowly it becomes something graspable, like the vague contours of a stranger appearing in the fog, inching closer to you from the vagueness beyond the horizon. Then it starts: My left iris pops right off, I pick it up and brush off the dirt as far as possible (it's sticky), and try to re-attach it to my eyeball. Now I'm on the operating table, my guts opened up and all my friends around me, just hanging out I guess, in an atmosphere of casual fun. Then, a machine ... fuelled by fumes?
