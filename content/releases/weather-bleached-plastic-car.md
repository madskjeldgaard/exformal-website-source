I fall asleep at night as if unplugged. The thing is: I've run out of dreams. When drifting off, a vacuum greets me. I ask anyone who will listen: What are your dreams? They misunderstand, they start talking about becoming a pop star, being right here right now, buying a house, etc. I self diagnose: An acute lack of subconsciousness. I feed my Id with horrific sci-fi literature about creatures tearing through space and time; every night on my pillow, closing my eyes ... hoping ... come on Id, do your thing. As soon as I wake, I roll over and pick up an audio recorder I keep by my bed and with great expectations record whatever I have been dealt through the night: _nothing_.

After my morning routines, I seat myself by the piano, pressing one key at a time with ages of space in between each successive keypress, soaking up the vibrations of the metal seeping through the instrument's wooden enclosure, then turning my attention to the sounds from my open window, leaking in between the notes â€“ the banality of city sounds: Kids playing, a moped passing, bird feet rustling in the rain gutter above the window, it's the neighbourhood's magpies scheming again.

Days pass like this, one after the other. But then, the vague contours of a stranger appearing in the fog, inching closer to you from the vagueness beyond the horizon, slowly it becomes something graspable. And all of a sudden: My left iris pops right off, I pick it up and brush off the dirt as far as possible (it's sticky), and try to re-attach it to my eyeball. Now I'm on the operating table, my guts opened up and all my friends around me, just hanging out I guess, in an atmosphere of casual fun. Then, a machine ... fuelled by fumes?
